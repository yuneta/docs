What is Yuneta?
===============

Yuneta_ is a C development framework.

Internal features:
    * asynchronous I/O, based in libuv_ library.
    * structured data, based in `ASN.1`_ standard.
    * json_ data, based in jansson_ library.
    * finite state machine, based in ginsfsm_ library.
    * communication between yunos by json_ messages.

Yuneta goal is **create** daemons or cli's, also called *yunos*.

Yuneta also give you a platform for **deploy** and **operation** of *yunos*.

Yuneta_ allows you to organize the *yunos* in **realms** of *yunos*.

A *yuno* can be a standalone program, ie, a utility,
or can be a collaborator program, ie, a service,
living in a realm sharing the world with others *yunos*.

*Realms* of *yunos* can be easily cloned, even running realms
with all his persistent data.

Installation
============

Introduction
------------

Yuneta uses a fixed directory for develop and deploy/operation,
associated with a shared group (**yuneta**).
This name are fixed, although it has been chosen to rarely
match other names:

    - ``/yuneta``

        Shared group directory for development, deploy and operation of realms and yunos.


.. note::

    You can read about Linux permissions in `Linux permissions demystified`_.

.. _`Linux permissions demystified`: http://blog.superuser.com/2011/04/22/linux-permissions-demystified/


To install Yuneta_ follow the next instructions in order.

AS SUDO
-------

These commands must be executed by a **sudo** user.

* Create the file ``/etc/profile.d/yuneta.sh`` and add the next content::

    # By default, we want umask to get set. This sets it for login shell
    # Current threshold for system reserved uid/gids is 200
    # You could check uidgid reservation validity in
    # /usr/share/doc/setup-*/uidgid file
    if [ $UID -gt 199 ] && [ "`id -gn`" = "`id -un`" ]; then
        umask 002
        ulimit -c unlimited
    fi

``ulimit -c unlimited`` to set core unlimited.

``umask 002`` to set group write permission for new files and directories.

* Add the following line to ``/etc/sysctl.conf``::

    kernel.core_pattern = core.%e

* Load sysctl settings::

    sysctl -p


In Ubuntu:
The /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern configuration setting is set when the apport crash reporting
service starts on system boot.
So the first step in the process would be to disable apport.
This can be done by editing the /etc/default/apport file, and setting enabled=0.

At this point, the kernel default core pattern should remain on boot.
If you want to switch to some other pattern you can do this by placing
a file in /etc/sysctl.d that ends in .conf (e.g. 60-core-pattern.conf).
It's contents should look something like this (adjusting for your desired pattern)::

    kernel.core_pattern = core.%e

That should cause your custom pattern to be loaded on boot.
You should be able to test it without rebooting by running sudo::

    sysctl --system.




* Create the **shared** user/group ``yuneta``::

    adduser --home=/yuneta yuneta
    chmod 775 /yuneta/
    chmod g+s /yuneta/


* Install next packages:

                Data valid while realm live.

                Temporal data files. Can be delete in a machine restart.

            /logs
                Log files.

    /repos
        **persistent**.

        Local repository of *yuno*'s binaries and *yuno*'s configurations.

    /store
        **persistent**.

        Home of *agent.db*.

        /backup
            Backup of databases in json format files.

        /service
            Databases of yuno's services.


.. note::
    To clone a living realm you must to copy the **persistent** directories.

    The agent yuno supports by default the next sizes:

        - maximum yuno binary size: 50M.
        - maximum configuration element size: 50M.
        - maximum memory used by ``yuneta_agent`` and ``yuneta`` yunos: 200M.

    These limits are actually set by the maximum memory block
    that are configurated in ``yuneta_agent`` and ``yuneta`` yunos.
