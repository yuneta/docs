What is Yuneta?
===============

Yuneta_ is a C development framework.

Internal features:
    * asynchronous I/O, based in libuv_ library.
    * structured data, based in `ASN.1`_ standard.
    * json_ data, based in jansson_ library.
    * finite state machine, based in ginsfsm_ library.
    * communication between yunos by json_ messages.

Yuneta goal is **create** daemons or cli's, also called *yunos*.

Yuneta also give you a platform for **deploy** and **operation** of *yunos*.

Yuneta_ allows you to organize the *yunos* in **realms** of *yunos*.

A *yuno* can be a standalone program, ie, a utility,
or can be a collaborator program, ie, a service,
living in a realm sharing the world with others *yunos*.

*Realms* of *yunos* can be easily cloned, even running realms
with all his persistent data.
